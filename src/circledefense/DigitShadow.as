 * Author:  Georbec Ammon (u0552894@utah.edu)
 * Date:    Fall Semester 2013
 * Partner: I worked alone 
 * Course:  Computer Science 1410-EAE
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * This constructor takes:    an "owner" sprite that will use multiple digit sprites
 an x coordinate to draw the digit
 a y coordinate to  draw the digit
 which number to draw
 a fill color
 a stroke (line) color
 This file will take in parameters in order to draw a "digit" (0-9)
 with the createDisplayList function.
 
 
 Of note is that this DigitShadow will draw both the parts of the digit that are "turned on" and the parts
 that are "off," in green and red outline, respectively.

		 In DigitShadow, now we will use two different drawing methods for "on" and "off."
